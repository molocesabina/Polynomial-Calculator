# Polynomial-Calculator
A polynomial calculator with a dedicated graphical interface through which 
the user can insert polynomials, select the mathematical operation (i.e. addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, division, derivative, integration) to be performed and view the result.

Used an object-oriented programming design and implemented the graphical user interface with Java Swing.
